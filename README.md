A focus timer for students. Level up your work with a systematic focus routine and focus statistics!

## 🍅 How does it work?

Tempo makes use of the popular [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which is a time management technique developed in the 1980s.

A typical pomodoro (Italian for "tomato) technique consists of a **25 min** focus session, a short **5 min** break, then looping back to the 25 min session until 4 focus sessions are done. Then, take a long **15 min** break. After that, the cycle repeats itself.

I don't have an Apple Developer account, which means that when opening the app, your Mac will say something like:

```"Tempo" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.```
